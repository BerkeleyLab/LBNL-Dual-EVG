<h1>How to Update Firmware</h1>
<p>These instructions present the procedure to create a bootable image 
containing FPGA firmware and application software and to transfer this 
image to flash memory.&nbsp; The instructions assume that a Vivado 
session with the desired project is running.&nbsp; The procedure is made
 more difficult by some annoying flaws in the Xiinx development tools.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click File→Export→Export Hardware….</li>
  <li>In the 'Export Hardware' window that pops up ensure that the 
'Include bitstream' box does not have a check mark, then click 'OK'.</li>
  <li>Start Vitis and select the ALSUeventGenerator workspace.</li>
  <li>In the project hierarchy window highlight and right click on 
ALSUeventGenerator_platform and select 'Update Hardware Specification'.</li>
  <li>In the 'Update Hardware Specification' window that pops up confirm
 that the 'Hardware Specification File:' field refers to the 
ALSUeventGenerator.xsa file then click 'OK',.</li>
  <li>In the completion window that pops up, click 'OK'.</li>
  <li>That should be it, but a flaw in the 2019.3 tools used for this 
project means that some extra steps are required.&nbsp; In the platform 
hierarchy pane, highlight the 'Board Support Package' entry then&nbsp; 
click 'Reset BSP Sources'.&nbsp; In the 'Reset BSP Sources' confirmation
 window that pops up, click 'Yes' then, in the error window that pops up
 a little later, click 'OK'.</li>
  <li>In the project hierarchy window highlight and right click on 
ALSUeventGenerator_platform and select 'Build Project'.&nbsp; If the 
progress pane at the lower center of the window shows just a single line
 of the form "XSDB Server Channel: tcfchan#1" you must repeat from step 4.</li>
  <li>In the project hierarchy window highlight and right click on 
ALSUeventGenerator_system and select 'Build Project'.&nbsp; View the 
build progress in the progress pane at the lower center of the window.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In a terminal window cd to the ALSUeventGenerator/src directory in
 the ALSUeventGenerator project workspace then run ''sh startVitis.sh 
bash'.&nbsp; This starts a shell session with environment variables that
 enable the Xilinx development tools.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In a terminal window cd to the ALSUeventGenerator/scripts 
directory in the ALSUeventGenerator project workspace then run 
'make'.&nbsp; This will leave a 'download.bit' file in the scripts 
directory.</li>
  <li>If a suitable application is already running on the FPGA follow 
the steps below.&nbsp; If this is a new FPGA, or for whatever reason 
there is 
no suitable application running on it, use the <a href="BringingUpNewBoard.html">USB/JTAG connection</a> to download and run the application and then run the programFlash.sh script.</li>
<li> Run the 
programFlash.sh script with the 'B' option.&nbsp; This uses TFTP to transfer the 
download.bit file to the alternate boot image in the flash memory and then to read back the flash 
memory contents to confirm that the transfer and flash write 
succeeded.&nbsp; For example:<br>

&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">sh programFlash.sh B 131.243.93.169</span></span></li>
<li>Connect to the FPGA console and boot the new image by providing the '-b' argument to the 'boot' command:<br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">boot -b</span></span><br>

Alternatively, press and hold the Display button then press the Reboot/Recovery button for a couple of seconds.<br>

This directs the FPGA to boot the alternate image that was transferred to the flash memory in step 13.</li>
<li>If the FPGA boots and starts properly go on to the next step, otherwise 
press the Reboot/Recovery button for a couple of seconds or power cycle 
the unit to reboot the old firmware in the base boot image.</li>
<li>Run the 
programFlash.sh script without the 'B' option.&nbsp; This uses TFTP to transfer the 
download.bit file to the base boot image in the flash memory and then to read back the flash 
memory contents to confirm that the transfer and flash write 
succeeded.&nbsp; For example:<br>


&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">sh programFlash.sh 131.243.93.169</span></span></li>
<li>Connect to the FPGA console and issue the 'boot' command with no 
arguments, or press the Reboot/Recovery button for a couple of seconds, 
or power cycle the unit to reboot the new base boot image.<br>
  <span style=" font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"></span><span style=" font-weight: bold;"><span style=" font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"></span></span></li>

</ol>
<p>To update the flash memory after making changes to the application software, start at step 9.<br>
